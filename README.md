# Better Weather
Welcome to our INFO490 & 491 Capstone, Team Boba's working repository! <br/>

## Project Info
Today, Seasonal Affective Disorder affects more than 15 million people in the U.S., with women four times more likely to be diagnosed with it than men. At the same time, the current pandemic makes more people live under limited social interaction and reduced sunlight exposure, which are leading factors that could cause/exacerbate SAD. <br/>
This designed solution, Better Weather, is a website that merges basic chat and recommendation features in order to give supports and help sufferers combat SAD. Through its different feature pages, users have the chance to foster connectedness& peer support, stress relief, increase possible light exposure, and ultimately improve their mood.<br/>

## App Structure
<span style="font-size:17px;">**Frontend: JavaScript, CSS, HTML**</span><br>
The whole project is constructed by using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, which are great for multiple reasons, including:<br>
<ul>
<li>Relatively easy to learn</li>
<li>Offer plenty of flexibility and creativity </li>
<li>The backbone of Front End development</li>
<li>Plenty of libraries to use</li>
</ul>
There are downsides to this, however, including:
<ul>
<li>The browser interprets JavaScript differently in different browsers</li>
<li>Lack of debugging facility </li>
<li>Since the JavaScript code is viewable to the user, others may use it for malicious purposes</li>
</ul>

The code are under the folders <code>/src</code> and <code>/public</code>. The Chat Engine we constructed in our app in using React, and the rest functions are based on JavaScript, including <code>index.js</code>, <code>app.js</code>, <code>travel.js</code>, and <code>music.js</code>. The construction of the webpage under HTML is under <code>/public</code> folder, including <code>index.html</code>, <code>landing.html</code>, <code>aboutus.html</code>, <code>music.html</code>, and <code>travel.html</code>. Images we use in under <code>/public/img</code>, and datasets we have in under <code>/public</code> in two different formats, which are <code>.json</code> and <code>.csv</code>.
