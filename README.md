# Better Weather
Welcome to our INFO490 & 491 Capstone, Team Boba's working repository! <br/>

## Project Info
Today, Seasonal Affective Disorder affects more than 15 million people in the U.S., with women four times more likely to be diagnosed with it than men. At the same time, the current pandemic makes more people live under limited social interaction and reduced sunlight exposure, which are leading factors that could cause/exacerbate SAD. <br/>
This designed solution, Better Weather, is a website that merges basic chat and recommendation features in order to give supports and help sufferers combat SAD. Through its different feature pages, users have the chance to foster connectedness& peer support, stress relief, increase possible light exposure, and ultimately improve their mood.<br/>
