# Capstone490_TeamBoba
Welcome to our INFO490 Capstone, Team Boba's working repository! <br/>
For this project, our targeted final product is a functioning web that is adaptable to mobile devices and merges basic social media features into weather forecasts. Through recommendation algorithms, it feeds users with sunnier locations and cheerful music as a SAD mind-body therapy. It also aims to facilitate connectedness and overall give the SAD group coping strategies and support for brighter attitudes.
